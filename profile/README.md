👋 **Hi there!**  
We are a team of **Electrical and Electronic Engineers** studying at the **University of Technology Sydney (UTS)**.  
Our focus lies in **FPGA design, digital logic, and embedded systems** — transforming HDL into hardware and ideas into innovation.  

---

## 🧠 What We Do

- 🔧 **FPGA Design & Verification** — VHDL/Verilog development, simulation, synthesis, and timing analysis  
- 🌐 **Networking & Protocols** — Custom 10BASE-T switch design, Manchester encoding, CRC-32 modules, and PHY interfacing  
- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems** — MCU integration, bus communication, and control logic  
- 📈 **Testing & Validation** — Automated testbenches, functional verification, and post-synthesis debugging

## 🧑‍💻 Who We Are

We’re a small, hands-on team of engineers who enjoy the craft of digital design — from HDL synthesis and PCB routing to testing on real silicon.  
We thrive on **collaboration**, **problem-solving**, and a touch of **over-engineering elegance**.

> 🧠 *“Measure twice, simulate once, synthesise forever.”*
