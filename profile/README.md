# ⚡ UTS FPGA Network Engineering Team

> “Turning logic into reality — one bitstream at a time.”

👋 **Hi there!**  
We’re a team of **Electrical and Electronic Engineers** from the **University of Technology Sydney (UTS)** specialising in **FPGA design, embedded systems**, and **digital hardware development**.  
Our projects span everything from Ethernet PHY implementations and custom CRC modules to sustainable embedded control systems and signal processing.

## 🧠 What We Do

- 🔧 **FPGA Design & Verification** — VHDL/Verilog, simulation, synthesis, and timing closure  
- 🌐 **Network Systems** — 10BASE-T Ethernet, Manchester encoding/decoding, CRC-32, and MAC-layer logic  
- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems** — Microcontroller integration, peripheral interfacing, and real-time signal handling  
- 📈 **System Modelling & Testing** — Testbenches, timing analysis, and verification frameworks
